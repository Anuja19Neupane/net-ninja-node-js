# 1. Introduction and setup

→ code that runs in browser is front-end

→ code that runs in server is back-end

→ We can’t run javascript directly in computer or server, node allows us to do this.

→ V8 engine compiles javascript code into machine code . Node.js wraps v8 engine, since node is written in c++, it can run in our computer directly.

## **Node.js**

→ node.js adds more features to javascript like:

1. read and write files on a computer 
2. connects to a database
3. act as a server for content
